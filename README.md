Small fix for homeys that have older software versions

Added current date & time to triggers Incomming Call & Call Anwsered

### v 0.0.5
Changed localize bug.

### v 0.0.4
In this release we have added the phonebook list from Fritz.Box. Unfortunatly we could not make an automatic update between Fritz.Box and Homey. The way I solved it is download the phonebook from FritzBox and copy the contents in the box on the settings screen. This is the best I could do. Currently it is experimental and only tested with the phonebook from FritzBox 06.52. Only one phonebook is currently supported.


### v 0.0.3
bugfix socket did not close and some typo's

### v 0.0.2
bugfix condition cards. This works now correctly.


### v 0.0.1
First release
